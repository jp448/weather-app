# weather-app
 A frontend coding challenge

**Introduction**

This app was created for a frontend coding challenge. It was created using React and the Open Weather API

**Demo**

[weather app](https://weather-app.proctor-webworks.com/)

**App Features**
* works with the Open Weather API to get real-time data
* on refresh a random city is selected and the weather is displayed
* users can specify both city and country when using the search tool
* weather information is dynamic including weather icon

**App Structure**

The app is split into several different components. An index component as usual. An app component which renders all components and includes the calls to the API. A weather-display component which contains all the info about the weather for the city selected.  

**App Improvements**

If I had more time here are the improvements I would make to the app: 
* Improve code by refactoring. 
* use react forms to improve the form
* use react plugin select to improve drop down menu for countries
* Add tests.
